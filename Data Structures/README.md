# What is a *Data Structure*

A **Data Structure (DS)** is a way of organizing *data* so that it can be used effectively. In other words **DS** are ways to store data or collection of values.

Values can have relationship among them and they can have functions applied to them.

Each **DS** has advantage and disadvantage to the problem.


<add later>

**Algorithms** are functions or was to use **DS** to write program. In other words are the steps or processes we put into place to manipulate these collections of values.

> **Data Structures** + **Algorithms** = **Programs**

## Why Data Structures are important

- Essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- Help to manage and organize data.
- Make code cleaner and easier to understand.

# List of **Data Structures**

| Data Structures | |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Arrays | Trees |
| Stacks | Tries |
| Queues | Graphs |
| Linked Lists | Hash Tables |

-----

| Algorithms |
| --------------- |
| Sorting |
| Dynamic Programming |
| BFS + DFS |
| Recursion |

_These list are not all DS or Algorithms but are the ones that used 90% of the time_

# Operations on **DS**

* Insertion
* Deletion
* Traversal
    * Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
* Searching
* Sorting
* Access
    * Most important one, How do we access this data that is on our computer.

# What is a *Abstract Data Type*

**Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details but how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

## Examples
| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| List              | Dynamic Array, Linked List |
| Queue             | Linked List Based Queue, Array Based Queue, Stack Based Queue|
| Map               | Tree Map, Hash Map, Hash Table |
| Vehicle           | Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car |
