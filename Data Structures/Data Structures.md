# What is a *Data Structure*

A **Data Structure (DS)** is a way of organizing *data* so that it can be used effectively. In other words **DS** are ways to store data.

<add later>

**Algorithms** are functions or was to use **DS** to write program.

## Why Data Structures are important

- Essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- Help to manage and organize data.
- Make code cleaner and easier to understand.

# What is a *Abstract Data Type*

**Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details but how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

## Examples
| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| List              | Dynamic Array, Linked List |
| Queue             | Linked List Based Queue, Array Based Queue, Stack Based Queue|
| Map               | Tree Map, Hash Map, Hash Table |
| Vehicle           | Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car |
